# ScintillatorSim
This simulation was written during studying of GEANT4 and evolutionate with time from a one crystal into a crystal array. Now it forms the basis of SpecMATscint. The latest stable version with a one crystal is stored here. Crystal could take two of the most widespread detector shapes, cubic and cylinder.
